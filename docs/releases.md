# Release notes

### 6.1.22 (2019-06-29)

**Enhancements**

* [#736](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/736) Updated <b>@MethodOwner</b> annotation. <b>secondaryOwner</b> parameter no longer exists, instead of this parameter added platform filter where neccessary:<br>
Note: previous single @MethodOwner annotation without platform works as well
```
@MethodOwner(owner = "user1", platform = "android")
@MethodOwner(owner = "user2", platform = "ios")
``` 
* [#749](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/749) Added ability to set custom test data directory name. This functionality is available via <b>  ReportContext.setCustomTestDirName("customName") </b> method.
* [#751](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/751) provided anonymous access to carina [CI jobs](https://ci.qaprosoft.com/jenkins/job/carina)
* [#752](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/752) Added generation of [JavaDoc](https://ci.qaprosoft.com/jenkins/job/carina/job/carina-CENTRAL-RELEASE/javadoc/)
* [#754](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/754) Renamed <i>browser_locale</i> property to <i>browser_language</i><br>
<b>Note:</b> make sure to update your project  _config.properties accordingly to be able to override browser language!

### 6.0.6 (2019-01-07)

**Enhancements**

* [#607](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/607) refactor DevicePool logic integrating it completely into DriverPool<br>
<b>Note:</b> Due to the removed DevicePool class some code refactoring on project level needed. 
Mostly for devicePool.getDevice() which is not available anymore:
```
DevicePool.getDevice(); 
// it should be replaced in most cases by
getDevice();

// for the use-case when you need it in static way use
IDriverPool.getDefaultDevice();

// Also we have new methods to get device by driver name!
getDevice("default"); // return device assigned to "default" driver
getDevice("custom"); //return device addigned to "custom" driver.
// if no driver discovered in the pool with provided name then nullDevice will be returned
```
* [#610](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/610) Declared easy way to control drivers quit on project layer. You can disable core logic with no way to enable it back for current test run. Anyway, Carina will close drivers on suite finish. 
```
// Execute as only you would like to disable automatic drivers quit
CarinaListener.disableDriversCleanup();
```
* [#581](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/581) Agreed to avoid drivers keep for depenent groups. In case you need it please disable automatic drivers quit according to the step above and organize quit using your own logic.

### 6.0.2 (2018-12-04)

**Enhancements**

* Starting from 6.0.x carina-core became a listener with unified CarinaListener class:
    * most of the AbstractTest core methods moved to CarinaListener
    * incorporated HealthCheckListener as part of CarinaListener
    * splited initialization logic into static block and ISuiteListener->onStart(suite) method
    * incorporated DriverPool cleanup on shutdown hook
    * **Note:** some changes are incompatible in comparison with 5.x.x versions and need manual updates according to the **Migration Steps** 
* Migrated to the latest 6.14.3 TestNG version with fully supported retry execution feature
* Updated build numbering structure according all qaprosoft projects:
    * **6**.0.0 - core generation
    * 6.**0**.0 - service pack release
    * 6.0.**0** - cross release build number which starts from 0 in 6th generation (in 5.x.x.x release latest build number is 5.3.3.**129**)
* Finalized integration rules for Zafira integration:
    * Add ZafiraListener in global pom.xml to inject it for all CI runs
    * Add ZafiraListener into each TestNG suite to be able to run locally with Zafira integration
    * Note: carina archetype updated accordingly
* Refactored DriverPool class and deliver it as functional IDriverPool interface
    * It allowed to remove driver_mode property and calculate driver lifecycle automatically based on rules below:
         * All drivers started during @BeforeSuite phase are saved across all suite run
         * All drivers started during @BeforeClass phase are saved across current test class run
         * All drivers started during @BeforeMethod phase or inside method are saved only for current method and closed automatically
         * To be able to keep "method mode" drivers just use dependsOnMethods property in @Test annotation.
```
Example:
    @Test()
    public void test1() {
        getDriver(); //start new driver
        ...
    }
    @Test(dependsOnMethods="test1")
    public void test2() {
        getDriver(); //get existing driver started in test1 as test2 depends on test1
        ...
    }
    @Test()
    public void test3() {
        getDriver(); //start new driver as no dependencies detected
        ...
    }
```
* Moved unit tests into the valid modules to be able to track coverage results in [Sonar](https://ci.qaprosoft.com/sonarqube/dashboard/index?did=2)
* Move some noisy log messages onto the DEBUG level
* added possibility to redefine log level for explicit sub-modules/classes
```
core_log_level=DEBUG
core_log_packages=IDriverPool,ZafiraConfigurator
```
* added support for Opera browser. For now both variants are ok:
    * browser=opera
    * browser=operablink 
* Removed all TestRail updaters from Carina and all required dto classes. Integration with 3rd party testcase management tools will be allowed through the [zafira](https://github.com/qaprosoft/zafira) only!
* Removed SMTP integration settings from Carina. All notification methods will be concentrated in Zafira Reporting Tool. Carina could only run and generate local report in ./reports/qa folder.
* Removed completely JUnit libraries from classpath to avoid invalid asserts import inside the test classes on projects level
* Removed cucumber integration as not used feature
* Removed all deprecated methods in DriverHelper
* Removed deprecated constructors in ExtendedWebElement class

**Fixes**

* Improved driver restart logic fixing [#364](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/364) and [#552](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/552).
* removed soapui.log4j.config property
